# Package Manager Choice: npm vs pnpm

## Summary

This project uses **npm** as its primary Node.js package manager.

## Evidence

1. **Lock Files**: `package-lock.json` (npm) is maintained and tracked in git
2. **Dockerfiles**: All Dockerfile* files reference `npm install` (not pnpm)
3. **Scripts**: All documented commands use `npm` (dev, build, start, lint)
4. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows use `npm` (when present)

## History

- **Before (Dec 2024)**: Both `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `package-lock.json` were present
- **Change**: Removed `pnpm-lock.yaml` (redundant, not actively used)
- **Current State**: Only npm is used

## Recommendation

If you want to use a different package manager (pnpm, yarn, etc.):

1. Delete `package-lock.json`
2. Run the new package manager to generate its lock file
3. Update all Dockerfiles to use the new manager
4. Update documentation to reference new manager
5. Ensure CI/CD also uses the new manager

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Production start
npm start

# Linting
npm run lint
```
